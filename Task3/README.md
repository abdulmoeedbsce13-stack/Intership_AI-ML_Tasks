# ðŸ“ˆ Task 3: Apple Stock Price Prediction using Random Forest

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this task is to analyze historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL), visualize trends and relationships, and build a predictive model using a **Random Forest Regressor** to forecast the next day's closing price.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Used

- **Name:** Apple Stock Data (AAPL)
- **Source:** Yahoo Finance via `yfinance` API
- **Time Period:** 2022-01-01 to 2024-12-31
- **Description:** Historical stock data including Open, High, Low, Close prices, and Volume. Additional technical indicators like moving averages, daily returns, and volatility are calculated for modeling.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools and Libraries

- `yfinance` â€“ to download real-time stock data  
- `pandas`, `numpy` â€“ for data manipulation  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` â€“ for visualization  
- `scikit-learn` â€“ for model training, scaling, and evaluation  
- `joblib` â€“ to save/load the model
